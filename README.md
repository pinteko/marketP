Hi there. It's my online book shop. This project is based on micro-service architecture.
Micro-services communication is through the gateway-service (netty-server).
I used AngularJS for front-page of this shop.
For storing goods in the basket I used Redis database.
I used Spring Framework, Spring Data JPA, Lombok, Javax.validation, Flywaydb, PostgreSQL, Redis, AngularJS in this project.
